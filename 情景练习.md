### What are the benefits to having police officers in the community?

>     * "the cost of living" 正确   习惯默认  living 是经济living。文化差异导致
>   * The financial losses caused by crime
> * maintaining security 维护安全------> Keeping the community safe --------> Ensuring safety
> * far exceed the cost of 远超 xxxx 的花费 **be much greater than**, saves more in the long run, **outweigh**

3. the presence of police officer can rise which benefit the running of community

> The presence of police officers can enhance the **sense of security**, which benefits the smooth functioning of the community.

### 小记 2025-1-22

效果很好，发现还要记住很多固定的词组，比如工作，performce of job，secure job， steady job，stable postion

词组的本质是 形容词＋名词 educational pattern 和 pattern of education 前者更加自然。

也知道了，简化的说法，比如there be 有些时候不如 直接点的 is there ，exist

未来的学习，重在口语，轻在写作。原因是我大多数情况下能看懂，且口语化的写作影响不大

两天的努力就有明显的效果，努力努力
