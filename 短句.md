Have been 强调过程/ Have 强调结果

We **have waited** for an hour（等了一个小时，可能还在等，也可能刚等完）

以上两句都正确。

I have been studying English for three years `How long have you been studying English?`强调的是过程

I have studied English for three years `How long have you studied English?` 强调的是时间

1️⃣ **如果 "has been" 后面是** **形容词** **(sick, busy, tired...)** 或 **V-ing（raining, working, running...)**，那么是**持续性**。
2️⃣ **如果 "has been" 后面是** **V-ed（过去分词）**，那么是**被动语态**。

示例

1️⃣ **We have been waiting** for the bus for 30 minutes, and it's still not here. （**还在等**，强调**持续性**）
2️⃣ **They have waited** outside for 2 hours, so they decided to leave. （**等完了，已经决定不等了**，强调**结果**）
